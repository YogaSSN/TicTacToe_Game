## 🧠 AI Implementation

The AI uses:

### 🔹 Minimax Algorithm
Evaluates all possible future game states recursively and chooses the optimal move.

### 🔹 Alpha-Beta Pruning
Optimizes Minimax by eliminating unnecessary branches, reducing computation time significantly.

This ensures:
- Optimal move selection
- Faster decision making
- Efficient search performance

## 📸 How the Game Works

1. Player clicks on any empty cell.
2. The symbol **X** is placed.
3. AI automatically responds with **O**.
4. The game checks:
   - Rows
   - Columns
   - Diagonals
5. The winner or draw is displayed.
